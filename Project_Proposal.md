### Project Proposal - Predicting win/loss rate of ranked game in League of Legends (5 vs 5 multiplayer online game)

Question/need:
* Is it possible to predict the win/loss rate of ranked game(League of Legends) with classification model?
* The goal of this project is to try to accurately predict the win/loss rate of the ranked match games to possibly provide insights as to what factors
influence the game

Data Description:
* League of Legends ranked challenger dataset from Kaggle [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/gyejr95/league-of-legends-challenger-ranked-games2020/)
* 50 features, 24 features for both A+B team
* Target Variable: blueWins

Tools:
* Sklearn classification models: Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest, Decision Trees...etc
* Python for data manipulation 

MVP Goal:
* Determine the baseline classification model. Then try testing with the logistic regression modeling
